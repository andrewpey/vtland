Hello, fellow tycoons! We've got a [little intermediate update](/changelog#0.88.10) for you.

## Vehicles interiors

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/2.mp4" %}

Support for interiors has been one of the most requested features from our modding community, and now they're available. Interiors include driver cabins, passenger seating areas, and other parts of the vehicle's interior space, allowing players to experience vehicles from a first-person perspective.

Interiors are totally optional and purely cosmetic‚Äîthey won't affect performance during normal gameplay as they are visible only in the Ride Your Vehicle‚Ñ¢ mode. But if you love that extra bit of immersion, interiors are a great way to get up close and personal with your favorite vehicles.

Modders can define multiple custom player positions (camera spots) inside (or outside) each wagon, giving players more flexibility in choosing their view, whether it's enjoying different visual perspectives or enhancing specific gameplay scenarios like riding as a passenger or observing the animated cockpit in action.

To give you a taste, we've added interiors for a few Tier 1 vehicles, thanks to the awesome work by **scailman** (who also created a [helpful guide](https://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/creating-vehicle-interior/)). You can check them out now and use them as examples for creating your own mods. We'll be gradually adding more interiors to base vehicles over time.

To help you enjoy the interiors to the fullest, we've revamped the Ride Your Vehicle‚Ñ¢ UI to remove unnecessary windows and toolbars, giving you a cleaner view. We've added new default views‚Äîthird-person view and side view‚Äîbeside the already existing hood view and backwards view. Additionally, you can now switch between vehicles by clicking on them directly, without exiting the mode. And last but not least, the camera can now be freely rotated with RMB, without automatically returning to the forward position.

We‚Äôd also like to give a shout-out to the many new mods recently added to the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/732050/workshop/). Some creators are already working on adding detailed interiors, showcasing the incredible creativity of our community. We‚Äôre excited to see even more amazing mods in the future!

## Tilt and sway

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/3.mp4" %}

Vehicles now tilt and wagons sway when moving, enhancing the sense of realism and adding extra flair to your rides. Enjoy the gentle sway of the wagons with the new side view, or appreciate the movement of the vehicle suspension on tight curves.

## Better station queue management

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/1.mp4" %}

We've implemented an internal vehicle update queue to ensure first-in, first-out behavior at heavily loaded stations, helping to reduce delays and improve efficiency during peak times. Previously, a vehicle could get stuck for very long periods if more vehicles kept arriving at the station repeatedly. Thanks to this change, that is no longer the case.
