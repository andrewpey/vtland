As the holiday season approaches, festive decorations are back to bring a touch of seasonal charm to your tycoon empire. This year, weâ€™ve made them available a bit earlier, giving you extra time to enjoy decorating your world with **string lights** and **neon tubes**.

Use the controls in the **top-left corner** to toggle night mode and a snowy atmosphere, letting your decorations truly shine.

Weâ€™d love to see your holiday-themed builds! Share your screenshots and videos in our [Discord](http://discord.gg/voxeltycoon) and show us and the community how youâ€™ve embraced the holiday spirit.

We also want to take this opportunity to thank you for your patience and continued support. We know many of you have been eagerly awaiting major updates. While theyâ€™re taking longer than weâ€™d hoped, weâ€™re making steady progress. Our **biggest updates yet** are planned for **2025**, and weâ€™re excited to share more with you as they come together.

For now, enjoy the festive season, and thank you for being part of our journey. ðŸš‚âœ¨ðŸŽŠ
