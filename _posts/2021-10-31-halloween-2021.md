We are aware that many of you wonder if the next update is still in the works. And it is!

We don't have the date for it yet, but it should not take too long at this point. The update will be focused on the mass vehicle replacement, and this feature already took more time than it was originally expected - that's why we avoid giving any dates until we are completely sure we can meet them.

Partially, the delay is caused by our work in direction of expanding our team. This process is not easy (who would have thought!), and it grabs some of our resources from the development. Essentially, the current update is longer in development because we want to make a foundation for quicker development of future updates.

Anyways, the update will hit the [beta branch](/beta) soon, and you can actually see part of its functionality in the video above.

And of course, it's the perfect time to resurrect the **FREE** official Voxel Tycoon spin-off called [Railroad to Hell 3](/railroad-to-hell). Take a death ride and share your top scores!

Happy Halloween and see you next time ðŸŽƒ
