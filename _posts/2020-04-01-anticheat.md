Due to constantly increasing use of cheats in the game (<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+C</kbd>) we've decided to take action and stop players from gaining an unfair advantage.

Starting today, the new anti-cheat system will be enabled for all players to enforce fair play.

Introducing <b>VoxelWatch™ Anti-Cheat Enforcer</b>! Powered by top-notch neural networks, it will ban players permanently if the usage of cheats will be detected.

Please keep in mind that due to high amount of detected cases bans will be spread out in waves. If you used cheats and your account still hasn't banned, just give the system some time. Nobody is safe!

Thanks for your cooperation, and stay home!
