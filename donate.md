# Donate

<!-- {% include donate_btn.html %} -->

We want to be honest with you as possible, and that's the main reason why we are not accepting pre-orders — we want to make sure you'll pay for an actual game, that you actually enjoy playing, not just for promises.

However, we are aware that some of you would like to support us either way by making donations, so we can't ignore it anymore.

Any person who donates at least <span class="money">$1</span> will be *featured in the game credits* and receive a *supporter* role on [Discord](//discord.gg/64KPWd5).

> Please add the name you want to see in the credits as a note to payment or [contact us](mailto:dev@voxeltycoon.xyz) after making a donation.

If you are familiar with **Patreon**, here you go:

<a class="patreon" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7655118">

</a>

Alternatively, you can make one-time donation via **PayPal**:

{% include donate_btn.html %}

Or even via [Yandex.Money](http://yasobe.ru/na/voxeltycoon).
